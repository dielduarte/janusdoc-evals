# TaskFlow Documentation Style Guide

This style guide outlines the conventions and patterns used in the TaskFlow documentation. It serves as a reference for maintaining consistency across all documentation files.

## 1. Tone & Voice

- **Tone**: The documentation maintains a professional yet approachable tone. It is informative and direct, aiming to provide clear instructions and explanations.
- **Voice**: The use of the second person ("you") is common, making the documentation feel more engaging and user-centric. For example, "Create a new task" directly addresses the user.
- **Active vs Passive Voice**: The documentation predominantly uses active voice to enhance clarity and directness. For example, "The service layer contains business logic" instead of "Business logic is contained in the service layer."

## 2. Structure

- **Document Organization**: Each document begins with a title followed by an overview, which provides context. Sections are clearly defined with headings and subheadings.
- **Heading Patterns**: Use of hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3) is consistent. For example:
  - H1 for main titles (e.g., `# Tasks API`)
  - H2 for major sections (e.g., `## Overview`)
  - H3 for subsections (e.g., `### GET /api/tasks`)
- **Sections**: Each section typically includes a description, parameters, request/response examples, and use cases where applicable.

## 3. Formatting

- **Code Blocks**: Code snippets are enclosed in triple backticks (```) for clarity. For example:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks
  ```
- **Bold/Italics**: Important terms or actions are often bolded for emphasis. For example, "Create a new task" is emphasized as a key action.
- **List Styles**: Bulleted lists are used for enumerating items, while numbered lists are used for step-by-step instructions. For example:
  - **Use Cases**: 
    - Dashboard displays
    - Progress tracking
  - **Steps**:
    1. Clone the repository
    2. Install dependencies

## 4. Conventions

- **API Documentation**: Each API endpoint is documented with the following structure:
  - **Method**: The HTTP method (e.g., `POST`, `GET`) is clearly stated.
  - **Endpoint**: The URL path is specified.
  - **Authentication**: Information about authentication requirements is included.
  - **Parameters**: Query and body parameters are described in tables for clarity.
  - **Response**: Success and error responses are documented with example payloads.
- **Parameter Descriptions**: Each parameter is described with its type, whether it is required, and a brief description.
- **Examples Format**: Examples are provided in code blocks, demonstrating how to use the API effectively.

## 5. Language

- **Technical Terminology**: The documentation uses technical terms relevant to API development and task management, such as "CRUD operations," "query parameters," and "status."
- **Jargon Level**: The level of jargon is appropriate for the target audience, assuming familiarity with basic API concepts and programming.
- **Sentence Complexity**: Sentences are generally concise and straightforward, avoiding overly complex structures. For example, "The Statistics API provides insights into task distribution across different states."

## Examples

### API Endpoint Example

```markdown
### POST /api/tasks

Create a new task.

**Request Body:**

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                     |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------|
| title       | string | Yes      | Task title                      |
| description | string | Yes      | Detailed description            |
| priority    | string | No       | Priority level: 'low', 'medium', 'high' |
```

### Code Example

```typescript
export function getTaskStats(): Record<TaskStatus, number> {
  const stats: Record<TaskStatus, number> = {
    [TaskStatus.TODO]: 0,
    [TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS]: 0,
    [TaskStatus.DONE]: 0,
  };

  for (const task of tasks.values()) {
    stats[task.status]++;
  }

  return stats;
}
```

By adhering to this style guide, contributors can ensure that the TaskFlow documentation remains clear, consistent, and user-friendly.
