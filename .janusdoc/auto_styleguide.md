# TaskFlow Documentation Style Guide

This style guide outlines the conventions and patterns used in the TaskFlow documentation. It serves as a reference for maintaining consistency across all documentation files.

## 1. Tone & Voice

- **Tone**: The documentation maintains a professional yet approachable tone. It is informative and direct, aiming to provide clear instructions and explanations.
- **Voice**: The use of the second person ("you") is common, making the documentation feel more engaging and user-centric. For example, "Create a new task" directly addresses the user.
- **Active vs Passive Voice**: The documentation predominantly uses active voice to enhance clarity and directness. For example, "The API layer handles HTTP requests" instead of "HTTP requests are handled by the API layer."

## 2. Structure

- **Document Organization**: Each document begins with a title and a brief overview, followed by sections that detail specific aspects of the topic.
- **Heading Patterns**: Headings are structured hierarchically using Markdown syntax:
  - `#` for main titles
  - `##` for major sections
  - `###` for subsections
- **Sections**: Each section is clearly defined, often including an overview, detailed explanations, examples, and use cases.

## 3. Formatting

- **Code Blocks**: Code snippets are enclosed in triple backticks (```) for clarity. For example:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks
  ```
- **Bold/Italics**: Important terms or actions are often bolded for emphasis. For example, "Create a new task" may be bolded to highlight the action.
- **List Styles**: Bulleted lists are used for unordered items, while numbered lists are used for ordered steps or sequences. For example:
  - **Use Cases**:
    1. Dashboard displays
    2. Progress tracking

## 4. Conventions

- **API Documentation**: Each API endpoint is documented with the following structure:
  - **Method**: The HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) is clearly stated.
  - **Endpoint**: The URL path is provided.
  - **Description**: A brief explanation of what the endpoint does.
  - **Request Body**: If applicable, a table or code block describes the expected request body.
  - **Response**: The expected response status and format are detailed.
- **Parameter Descriptions**: Parameters are described in tables, including their type, whether they are required, and a brief description.
- **Examples Format**: Examples are provided in code blocks, often prefixed with a brief description of what the example demonstrates.

## 5. Language

- **Technical Terminology**: The documentation uses technical terms relevant to APIs, TypeScript, and task management. Terms like "CRUD operations," "query parameters," and "status" are common.
- **Jargon Level**: The jargon level is appropriate for developers familiar with REST APIs and TypeScript. Explanations are provided where necessary to ensure clarity.
- **Sentence Complexity**: Sentences are generally concise and straightforward, avoiding overly complex structures. For example, "The Tasks API provides CRUD operations for managing tasks" is clear and to the point.

## Examples

### API Endpoint Example

```markdown
### POST /api/tasks

Create a new task.

**Request Body:**

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------------------|
| title       | string | Yes      | Task title                 |
| description | string | Yes      | Detailed description        |
| priority    | string | No       | Priority level: 'low', 'medium', 'high' |
```

### Code Block Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "New task",
    "description": "Task description"
  }'
```

### Use Case Example

```markdown
## Use Cases

The statistics endpoint is useful for:

1. **Dashboard displays** - Show task distribution
2. **Progress tracking** - Monitor team velocity
```

By adhering to this style guide, contributors can ensure that the TaskFlow documentation remains clear, consistent, and user-friendly.
